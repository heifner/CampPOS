CHG: New biometric library included (3.1.0.254) – Faint finger image enhancement 
CHG: BSAPI libraries are digitally signed

=====================
version 3.9 beta
=====================
- Enhanced support for area sensors. Multiple sessions with multiple area sensors 
  in one process can be opened concurrently.

- ADD two new device properties (ABS_DEVPROP_SYSTEM_ID and ABS_DEVPROP_SYSTEM_NAME)


=====================
version 3.6.1
=====================
- FIXED several minor bugfixes.

Known problems:

  operations.
- Minor enhancements for area sensors.
- ADD support for 3rd party devices with embedded UPEK sensors.

Known problems:
- ABSRawGrab and ABSRawGrabImage functions do not honour profile key 
  ABS_PKEY_WAIT_FOR_ACCEPTABLE for strip sensors in some situations.


=====================
version 3.5.2
=====================
- ADD support for area sensors
- ADD compatibility with Windows NT service
- ADD support for Terminal Services and Citrix
- ADD dynamic enrollment.
- ADD grabbing with dynamic image formats
- ADD BSSRV.DLL added, for client-server solutions.

  the biometric operation is called in.


=====================
version 3.0.1
=====================
- ADD global parameters - ABS_PARAM_OPEN_TOTAL_TIMEOUT, ABS_PARAM_OPEN_RETRY_UI_NOTIFY_TIMEOUT,
  ABS_PARAM_OPEN_RETRY_DELAY

Known problems: 
- Sending ABS_MSG_QUALITY_BACKWARD message from the ABSRawGrab function
  to callbacks does not work properly.


=====================
version 3.0
=====================
- ADD global antispoofing parameters
- ADD support for TCS4E

Known problems: 
- Sending ABS_MSG_QUALITY_BACKWARD message from the ABSRawGrab function
  to callbacks does not work properly.



=====================
version 2.5 update
=====================
- ADD bsapi merge module


=====================
version 2.5
=====================

- Supported devices: TCD41, TCD42 (embedded only), TCS4B, TCS4C and TCD50

- ADD biometric templates conversion
- updated documentation
- minor bugfixes
- ADD ABS_OPERATION_FLAG_USE_IDLE flag and corresponding ABS_MSG_IDLE
- updated bsgui.dll
- ADD ABS_MSG_DLG_SHOW and ABS_MSG_DLG_HIDE

=====================
version 2.5 beta
=====================
- Official Beta release


- Supported OS: MS Windows 2000, XP (32/64bit), Server 2003 (32/64bit) and 
                Vista (32/64bit)
- Supported devices:


Known Problems:
- Documentation should go further into details.
- Samples should be more comprehensive and understandable. Project files
  for MS Visual C should be included.
- There is bug with high level callback (when ABS_OPERATION_FLAG_LL_CALLBACK
  is not set in ABS_OPERATION::Flags). Under some circumstances it may cause
  that the callback is called after the operation ends if it is canceled
  with ABSCancelOperation(). (The callback is called from helper thread)
- Bsgui.dll with default callback implementation, providing standard GUI
  for the biometric operations, is not included in this beta.


=====================
version 2.5 pre-beta
=====================
- Initial release
- supported OS: MS Windows 2000, XP (32/64bit), Server 2003 (32/64bit) and Vista (32/64bit)
- Supported devices: 


The following features are not yet implemented in this version:
- Functions ABSCapture(), ABSGrab() and ABSRawGrab() are not yet implemented.
- Functions ABSSetSessionParameter() and ABSGetSessionParameter() are not 
  implemented. Currently all parameters are global, use ABSSetGlobalParameter() 
  and ABSGetGlobalParameter() instead.
- Flags in ABS_OPERATION are not yet respected (low level vs. high level callback)

Other notes:
- Headers and sample sources need some cleaning and comments.
- Some project files for MS Visual Studio will be added in future version 
  to the samples, so users can build them easily.
